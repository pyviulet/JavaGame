# Pac-Man Game (Learning Project)

This Pac-Man game was created as a learning project following a YouTube tutorial. The project helped me practice Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and GUI development using the built-in Java AWT/Swing library.

## What I Learned in this Project

- Create the game loop  
- Use JFrame and JPanel for the game window  
- Draw images and load the game map with TileMap  
- Implement click handlers for Pac-Man movement  
- Design a simple algorithm for random ghost movement  
- Detect collisions and manage game events  
- Display score and reset the game upon collisions
